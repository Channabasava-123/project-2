# Project 2: Recipe Page

## Learning Objectives

### HTML Concepts:
1. **Lists**: Use `<ul>` for ingredients and `<ol>` for instructions
2. **Headings**: Properly structure content with `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`
3. **Divs and Spans**: Use `<div>` for sections and `<span>` for inline styling

### CSS Concepts:
1. **CSS Selectors**: Use element, class, and ID selectors
2. **Positioning**: Apply relative and absolute positioning
3. **Box Shadows**: Add depth with box-shadow property
4. **Media Queries**: Make the page responsive for mobile devices

## Instructions

1. Create recipe structure in `index.html`:
   - Add a main heading (h1) for recipe name
   - Create an ingredients section with unordered list
   - Create an instructions section with ordered list
   - Use divs to organize sections
   - Add spans for special emphasis

2. Style the page in `styles.css`:
   - Use different selectors to style elements
   - Add box shadows to the container
A well-structured recipe page with:


A small, responsive recipe page that demonstrates key HTML and CSS concepts for building a structured content page.
**What's included**
- `choclate.html`: The recipe HTML file (open this in a browser to view the page).
- `recipe.css`: Styles used by the recipe page.
- `project-2/`: Supporting project folder (if present).
**Learning Goals**
- **HTML**: semantic headings (`<h1>`–`<h3>`), lists (`<ul>` for ingredients, `<ol>` for steps), and simple layout with `<div>` and `<span>`.
- **CSS**: selectors (element, class, ID), layout and positioning (relative/absolute), visual polish (box-shadow, spacing), and a basic media query for responsiveness.
How to view
- Open the file `choclate.html` in your browser (double-click or use `File -> Open`).
Suggested edits and tasks
- Update the recipe name and ingredient list in `choclate.html`.
- Tweak spacing and colors in `recipe.css` to personalize the design.
- Add a small image or badge using absolute positioning for practice.
